Smart Email Classifier
This is a machine learning-based Streamlit web app that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham** using a trained Naive Bayes model with TF-IDF vectorization.
If the email is classified as **Ham**, the app further assigns a **priority level** (High, Medium, Low) based on specific keywords in the message content.

 Features

- Allows CSV upload and result download
- Clean, simple user interface using Streamlit tabs
